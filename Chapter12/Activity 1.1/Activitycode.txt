The first exercise requires that the reader preview and explore the assets provided to them when creating the project in the first activity. No files will be provided here because all files will be downloaded by the reader when following this activity. Additionally, the files used here contain files that are larger than 100MB and therefore cannot be uploaded to the Github repository.
