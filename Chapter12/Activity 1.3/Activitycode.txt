In this exercise, the reader must import the remaining animations for the player character using the knowledge learned in the associated activity where we imported one animation and our main character mesh. The reader must also then create a character Blueprint using the SideScrollerCharacter class provided by the Side Scroller project template. The reader will then create a new Animation Blueprint using the AnimInstance class and our imported character skeleton. From there, the reader will apply our skeletal mesh and Animation Blueprint to our character Blueprint we created and replace the default character with ours inside of the default map.
