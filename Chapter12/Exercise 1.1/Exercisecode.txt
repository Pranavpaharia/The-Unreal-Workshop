The first activity requires that the reader create the new project for our game using the Side Scroller template project in the Unreal Engine Launcher. No files will be provided here because all files will be downloaded by the reader when following this activity. Additionally, the files used here contain files that are larger than 100MB and therefore cannot be uploaded to the Github repository.
